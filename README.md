# ix-lisbon-project-week-1

Here is the repo with the project brief and where you should push your final poker game .py file. Might be a good idea to edit this README to include a link to your blog (where in a post you should link this repo too) :) 

The deadline is **tomorrow (Friday) the 31st of May at 8pm**.


The poker game begins by prompting the user to input how many players will participate in the game. It then runs a loop that asks the user to enter the names of the players and adds these names to a list. A ard class is created that specify the card's rank and suit. Another __repr__ method helps format how the cards are presented. After a deck is created and cards are assigned to users, the game runs and the player with the highest value card wins.
